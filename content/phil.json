When I look back on what I was listening to most, I see that music primarily served as my comfort food. I found most of these songs in years past, and I listened to them for their familiarity.\n\nAlso, sometimes I like to play a single song on repeat for hours when I drive or write code. It makes time sort of melt away. Many of these songs served that purpose.",
