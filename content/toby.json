  "introtext": "I tripped over my own creations and stumbled out of my narrative. The epithet “bewilderment” was conferred by my partner who noticed the strange trance I fell into when walking through the botanical garden. In five different cities I stood still for twenty minutes, with my arms in the air like a tree. Among the redwoods I lay down to rest and experienced an erotic vision of nature: the earth curls up to me from far below, taking in my legs and torso at once. I decided fall would be about faith. Music that sounds like like rich topsoil, music like darkened water. Nothing is clear, but it is also nourishing. Erin asked me if I would play some of my “underwater music.”",
