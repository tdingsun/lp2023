      "description": "I'm sure everyone knows at this point that 250 is the artist behind the most popular NewJeans songs - From my short knowledge he produced Hype Boy, Attention, Ditto, Hurt etc. His own album mostly consists of this uniquely Korean genre of music called \\[ÎΩïÏßù]. I feel like I should know more about this genre but I don't...so anyway didn't listen to it a whole lot but it's a fun song! Personally, a bit more special as I learned all of the above through an article from one of my favorite columnists."
