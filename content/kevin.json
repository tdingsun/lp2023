      "description": "It feels fitting to open my list with this track because to me, the song evokes new beginnings (2023→2024)... it makes me feel brave when I am faced with big question marks. I like how the song builds throughout, only to collapse back into itself... like waves crashing back into the ocean."

      "description": "This summer felt strange to me. London summers in general, actually. They always start too late and end too early. There’s a hollowness to them too – I miss being in the US and seeing my best friends every day in the months where friendship and togetherness really mean everything. \n\nI love this song because it makes me think back to summers spent on the East Coast. A specific image comes to mind: standing at the top of the incline at Tillinghast Farm, watching friends and strangers funnel into the path down to the beach… I think back to Jump bikes, Whole Foods air-conditioning, rooftop parties, my back soaked with sweat at a subway station. I really miss it all."

      "description": "My go-to solo activity in the warmer months is walking everywhere – in the city, by the sea, around in circles, up and down the stairs. This song is music made for it. The wandering melody, the laidback beat, the performative nonchalance of it all. \n\nI take a deep breath of exhaust fumes and second-hand vape smoke as I cross the busy road in front of King’s Cross station… cold brew in hand, my keys jingling in sync with each step… da-da-da-da (forever)"
