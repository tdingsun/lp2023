      "description": "it feels fitting to kick off my list with this track because to me, the song evokes new beginnings and feelings of forced bravery when faced with looming unknowns (2023→2024).\n\ni like how the song builds throughout, only to collapse back into itself... like waves crashing in reverse, back into the ocean."

      "description": "the past couple of summers in london have felt strange to me. they always start too late and end too early. there’s a hollowness to them too. i miss being in the US and seeing my best friends every day in the months where friendship and togetherness really mean everything. \n\ni love this song because it makes me think back to summers spent in new york and providence. a specific image comes to mind: i'm standing at the top of the incline at tillinghast farm, watching friends and strangers funnel into the path down to the beach… i think back to jump bikes, whole foods air-conditioning, eating green grapes on rooftops, my t-shirt soaked with sweat at a subway station... i miss it all."

      "description": "speaking of summer, my go-to solo activity in the warmer months is always walking, wherever i am. this song is music made for it. the wandering melody, the laidback beat, the performative nonchalance of it all. \n\ni take a deep breath of exhaust fumes and second-hand vape smoke as i cross the busy road in front of king’s cross station… slippery grip on my nitro cold brew, my keys jingling in sync with each step to the beat… dada-da-da (forever)"

      "description": "this album came to me as i was overcoming severe jet lag, clocking in at about four hours of sleep each night for a week. as difficult as it was to power through the sleep deprivation during the day, i really enjoyed waking up between 4-5am each morning, feeling like the only person awake in the city. i fell into a rhythm of leaving the house before sunrise and walking with *suntub* until the supermarkets opened at 8am. the glossy lyrical imagery and ml buch’s crystal clear voice really complimented the brightening morning skies and the cool november air.\n\n![](/images/mlbuch.png)\n\ni saw her perform the album live a couple weeks later, and it was expectedly a perfect show. she wore an amazing pair of rhinestone skeleton trousers that reflected all the little lights."

      "description": "if *pretty in possible* is music made for walking, then *dreampoppers tribute* is made for running... the song starts off at a gentle pace, but once it reaches the 03:20 mark, it sends you running until your feet lift off the ground. as the music fades out, you're floating upwards towards the outer atmospheres... eventually vanishing with the twinkle and flash of a four-pointed star... ✦"

      "description": "all of 703's songs are crafted with razor-sharp precision to almost robotic effect. this isn't to say that they lack a human quality, rather the opposite. 703 scrapes away the excess from chunks of sound, leaving only skeletal frames remaining – sturdy emotional supports for supercharged feelings.\n\nlistening to *overbraid,* i picture little white petals in the wind, fluttering past gigantic transmission towers made of bone. with microscopic focus, i can almost hear the pops and clicks of whispered secrets, passing through the overhead powerlines at the speed of avoidance."

      "description": "this short song is a favourite of mine from an album best listened to in one sitting, from beginning to end. absorbed in this long-form way, *borne* plays out almost like a high-fantasy video game playthrough, complete with lore-expanding cutscenes narrated (in french) by soft-spoken superstars, malibu and simili gum.\n\nit's perfect background music for a drawing session, or just lying in bed all afternoon on a rainy, grey sunday."
