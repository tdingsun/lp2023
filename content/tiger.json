But seeing them lug around huge overstuffed ikea bags is actually so endearing!!! Their optimism through gritted teeth is so inspiring!!! Genuinely though, these girls have been the subject of so much intense scrutiny and criticism. Stop being mean to the them online!!! Or donâ€™t, either way weâ€™re good âœŠðŸ˜­ because us dives have their backs."

I mean, obviously, since it's k-pop, there has to be several contrived layers of meaning -- for SEVENTEEN, 'FML' also stands for 'faded mono life', 'fight for my life', and 'fallen, misfit, lost'. Oh well. The lyrics are still pretty epic, ex. \"In this fucking world, I'm the only idiot.\" Sooooo true. It's so delicious having pessimism validated by k-pop.\n\n![]()",

I remember. And so does Vernon.\n\nWhen I first heard this song I wasn't even a Seventeen fan, so I was just like lol, even kpop groups are participating in the emo/pop-punk revival. But now that I stan Vernon i've realized that this song is perfect. It's like the most beautiful, pristine, glittering cubic zirconia covered in grime, dirt, and sweat. It kinda has no right to be a good song... the way he pronounces 'wake me up' is genuinely bizarre, the line 'you can't save me from my sadness' feels a little too on the nose... and yet I stan. AND YET I STAN.\n\nVernon is genuinely kind of a wierdo, an also probably the member of Seventeen with the best taste. He's very \"music is my life\" and \"listens to  everything\" but I actually believe him, especially in comparison to other kpop stars who seem to just listen to like, dua lipa and drake and justin bieber (not that there's anything wrong with that). His spotify playlists include drain gang, PC Music, 100 gecs, dj chari and dj Tatsuki, jerskin fendrix, james ivy, yaeji... Like, which other kpop stars are listening to 2021 sunshine on a kick drum?? ðŸ˜­ \n\nCase in point, [GAM3 BO1 by Seventeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUpo878rejU), possibly the only(?) glitchcore kpop song, has Vernon all over it. Also worth watching: [this dance practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJnjCJvmFk), [this live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz7as0WFEbs).\n\nThe [Charli XCX remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilWduZ-ffLE) he was on is obviously historically significant even though its not actually that good.\n\nHis verse on [this (sic)boy song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuqwj7G2XXU) is actually pretty epic too. His line \"cause I'm not good at being lonely/but I'm not good at being sorry\" hiiiiits.",

      "description": " Iâ€™ve always called Brakence the epitome of â€˜boy musicâ€™ â€” spiky, swaggy, nihilistic, and virtuosic (synth nerd from the suburbs). Above all, its abrasively sincere, daring the listener to understand how it feels to be misunderstood. Even when the lyrics feel deliberately obtuse, he still pierces through the emotional complications with some singular, clarifying, brute-force truth. Like a dumb boy who has no idea how to describe his emotions (or â€” worse, needs an Infinite Jest amount of words to do so), but then suddenly says the most truest, clearest, simplest thing youâ€™ve ever heard. \n\nâ€¨â€¨â€˜introvertâ€™ is the penultimate track and thesis statement of the entire album. Itâ€™s a very sweet song. It shows off the best parts of his music â€” the melodic left-turns, the bisexual angst, the contrast between his deeper vocal range and his effortless falsetto. Itâ€™s also the perfect lead-in to the more stripped down final track on the album, â€˜hypochondriacâ€™, possibly the only song on the album in which all of Brakenceâ€™s walls are finally down. When the album ends, all the posturing has fallen apart. No more hiding behind overly pretentious ideas of high art.â€¨â€¨\n\nThe first time I listened to â€˜introvertâ€™, I rolled my eyes at the overly complex interlude. Like an infinitely unfolding fractal curve that technically has no dimensionality, it felt devoid of any actual meaning. But in the context of the album, the cloying meta-ness of the interlude feels pointed. Amidst of hyper-kinetic flurry of memetic references and sound bites, some larger entity (DMT machine elves, lol) supposedly eradicates Brakence. And then everything falls away. Hiding behind â€˜art qua artâ€™ was always a cover, a necessary defense â€” *(if I keep talkinâ€™ in circles / we could treat it like a joke)*. Only when the overworked yet underdeveloped frame narrative falls away, can he admit the dumbest, realest things. *(oh baby i only wanted you / i couldnt say it so im typing it on a cue)*. I think I get it. The truth is never able to be articulated easily, and if it is, then itâ€™s probably not the truth. You have to work at it. You have to take the circuitous route. You canâ€™t just name itâ€¦ but you can point to it. Hopefully thereâ€™s someone out there willing to follow the signs.\n\nâ€¨â€¨In that spirit, Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™m not willing to be fully sincere about how clairvoyantly relateable this song means to me. Listening to this song throughout the year has felt like a tiktok tarot card reading â€” so accurate, that Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m being conned.",
