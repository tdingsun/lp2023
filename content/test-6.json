        "description": "It’s hard for me to admit it but this song has felt so clairvoyantly relateable to me this year, like a tiktok tarot card reading that feels way too accurate. \n\nI’ve always called Brakence the epitome of ‘boy music’ — spiky, swaggy, (at times) nihilistic, and virtuosic (read: synth nerd from the suburbs). Above all, its abrasively sincere, daring the listener to understand how it feels to be misunderstood. Even when the lyrics feel deliberately obtuse and meandering, the emotional complications always gets piereced through by some singular, clarifying, brute-force truth. Like a dumb boy who has no idea how to describe his emotions (or — worse, needs an infinite jest amount of words to do so), but then suddenly says the most truest, clearest, simplest thing you’ve ever heard. \n\n‘Introvert’ is the penultimate track of the album, and is basically the thesis statement for the entire album. It’s a very sweet song. It really shows off the best parts of his music — the melodic left turns, the bisexual angst, the contrast between his deeper vocal range and his (surprisingly? beauiful) effortless falsetto. It’s also the perfect lead-in to the more stripped down final track on the album, ‘hypochondriac’, in which all of Brakence’s walls are finally down. When the album ends, all the posturing falls apart, and there is no more hiding behind overly pretentious ideas of high art.\n\nI’ve always kinda rolled my eyes at the interlude in ‘introvert’. Its overly complex, like an infinitely unfolding surface — a dragon curve that technically has no depth. But in the context of the last track, the cloying meta-ness of the interlude feels like it is meant to feel empty. It was always a cover (if I keep talkin’ in circles / we could treat it like a joke), a necessary defence for him to hide behind the overworked yet underdeveloped frame narrative. In the interlude, amidst of hyper-kinetic flurry of memetic references and sound bites, some larger entity (machine elves, eyeroll) supposedly eradicates Brakence, and then every falls away. Only then can he say the dumbest, realest things (oh baby i only wanted you / i couldnt say it so im typing it on a cue). \n\nIsn’t it so beautiful when everything falls apart?\n\nBecause i’m not willing to be fully sincere about how much this song actually means to me, i’ll end lightly — *damn, bi guys are really going through it just like the rest of us, huh?*"
